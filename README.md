# Personal Blog

## Creating Content

New blog posts can be created with:

```
$ hugo new posts/<year>/<post-title>.md
```

A local server can be run with:

```
$ hugo server -D
```

## Deploying

The blog is hosted as a GitHub Page. Builds and deployments happen automatically via GitHub Action when changes are pushed to the master branch.
