### Hello!

I'm Mario! I am a software engineer with a passion for simplicity, cloud-native applications, and organization. I currently work at Capital One in McLean, VA as a backend tech lead and engineering manager on our consumer credit monitoring application, [CreditWise](https://creditwise.capitalone.com). On the side, I'm a big fan of [Go](https://golang.com/) and serverless designs.

When I'm not at work, I pursue a wide array of activities such as D&D, running, and acting with and serving as treasurer of [The Arlington Players](https://thearlingtonplayers.org/)).

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/mleone10), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mleone5244), or {{< relme Mastodon "https://hachyderm.io/@mleone" >}}.
