### Hello!

I'm Mario! I am a software engineer specializing in cloud-native architecture, CI/CD optimization, and clean code practices. I currently work at Capital One in McLean, VA as a backend engineer on our consumer credit monitoring tool, [CreditWise](https://creditwise.capitalone.com). On the side, I'm slightly obsessed with the [Go](https://golang.com/) programming language and serverless design.

When I'm not at work, I pursue a wide array of interests, including community theater (mostly with [The Arlington Players](https://thearlingtonplayers.org/)), and D&D. I also enjoy running, journaling, reading, and discovering all that Northern Virginia has to offer.

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/mleone10), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mleone5244), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mleone5244).
