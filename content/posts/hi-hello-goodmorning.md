I have a sort of catch phrase at work that I use it to start every standup.  “Hi, hello, good morning!”  I don’t know where I got it or why it stuck, I was probably frantic one day and just vomited any greetings that came to mind.  But it has a nice flow and cadence, and it feels good to say.

My team knows to expect the “Hi, hello, good morning.”  They try to copy it and one-up me.  They don’t quite manage, but they get close.  I don’t know if that’s good or not, but I’m tickled by it at least.

To me, part of its appeal is the impact it has on my personal brand.  You can’t be too serious when you greet your team three times at once.  It’s distinctive and unique.  Mine.  It says “I’m ready to be here, and I haven't abandoned my personality to do so.  I invite you to do the same."

I suppose that's part of the brand I want to have.  Authentic.  I want to work with people as fellow humans, each of us trying to learn and grow and accomplish our professional goals, but also fully realized as individuals with our own quirks.  Bring your hobbies, I say, your travel plans and aspirations with you when you come to work!  We're here for a significant chunk of our lives.  It'd be a shame to abandon ourselves during that time.
