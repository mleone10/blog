I was introduced to David Allen's [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/) methodology in 2020, right as COVID was becoming a thing.  During a 10:10 with my manager at the time, I mentioned I was trying to find a way to keep all of my sprint stories, ad hoc requests, and career development goals organized.  She was quick to advocate for GTD, and I purchased the book soon after.

In brief, GTD is a methodology for capturing, clarifying, and completing the many pieces of information and requests for our time that cross our paths every day.  It advises collecting _everything_ immediately, deciding if it's something that must be done, delegated, trashed, archived, or incubated, and ultimately executing on what matters most.

Rather than recount the specifics of GTD here, I'll instead point you to [this excellent 15-minute overview](https://hamberg.no/gtd) by Erlend Hamberg.

## Laying the Groundwork in a Bullet Journal 

At the time, I was a fan of Ryder Carroll's Bullet Journal system - a simple framework of bullets and lists within a run-of-the-mill notebook.  My officemates were well acquainted with my habit of carrying a notebook, every page full of small, neat rows of bullets and dashes.  The strictness of my BuJo adherance varied; some days were sparse or missing entirely, others were full accounts of my day.

I was a fan of the Bullet Journal method for a few reasons:
1. It used a **physical notebook**.  I love the tactility of a real notebook, the portability.  There's no worrying about some company dropping support for a feature or losing my data.  And at work, I can't log into my personal Google account or easily share data between my work and personal profiles.  A notebook is the perfect solution.
1. It was **simple**.  Learn a few bullets, write down today's day, and you're off.  No special materials or intricate rituals.
1. It was **extensible**.  I could doodle, take meeting notes, sketch a design, track my habits, or remember a date with ease.  No fixed page formats or app limitations to work around.

But I didn't feel like the Bullet Journal worked well for _my_ work.  My work was messy, spontaneous.  The system gave me a way to record my day, but something was missing - more guidance around the _process_, rather than just how to write them down.

Enter GTD.

# Phase One - Google Keep
When I first read GTD, my big takeaway was the presence of five buckets:
* An **Inbox** for capturing notes, mentions, ideas, tasks, and requests
* A **Next Actions** list for those things I can do whenever I'm able
* A **Waiting For** list to capture things that are stuck until someone gets back to me or a specific date arrives
* A **Someday/Maybe** list for things I may want to do in the future
* A **Projects** list for projects (in GTD, any goal with a definite conclusion and more than one action is a Project)
