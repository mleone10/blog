A few weeks ago, something in me just...snapped.  I was doing my monthly migration in my bullet journal, copying outstanding next actions from April to May, when I realized that I had made a terrible, embarrassing mistake.  I had accidentally moved some personal next actions to my work list.  Horrified, I tried to remedy the situation by crossing out the erroneous entries and rewriting them on the correct page.  But the damage was done.  My work list, once a clean and minimal list of tasks, was now half-populated with crossed-out symbols of my failure.

I put down my pen, put my notebook in a drawer, and opened up Apple Reminders.  And I'm only kind of joking about how quickly that all happened.

That's right friends.  For the past three weeks, I've been using...

A *_digital_* GTD system.

If I'm being honest with myself, the allure of a digital GTD system has always appealed to me.  My phone is almost literally attached to my body, on my person wherever I go.  It only makes sense that my task management system be accessible through it.

I have two main gripes with digital task-tracking apps, though.  The first is dependability.  If my system is stored on someone else's server, then really I'm betting on the project's continued funding and the creator's continued interest.  That causes me to look upon most hot new applications with a wary eye, though options like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which give you full control of your data in a portable format are extremely attractive.

The second is the complexity that many apps devolve into.  The nature of product development is that the product evolves to suit the needs of its customers, needs that are quite varied for something like a task management app.  Over time, apps develop multiple categorization systems (projects, sub-lists, tags), date-tagging fields, collaboration features, and other features that risk pushing it from "functional" to "cluttered".

A paper notebook, on the other hand, is the antithesis of these two points.  Notebooks aren't going away anytime soon.  Sure specific brands rise and fall, but we will _always_ have some kind of bound paper product to hold notes.  They're also as simple or complex as the owner wishes.  My approach to bullet journaling was quite minimal, though others add all kinds of flags, tags, add-ons, bookmarks, and modifications to enable their own
