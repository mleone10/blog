I was introduced to David Allen's [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/) in 2020, right as the COVID19 pandemic was starting.  During a 10:10 with my manager at the time, I mentioned I was trying to find a way to keep all of my sprint stories, ad hoc requests, and career development goals organized.  She was quick to advocate for GTD, and I purchased the book soon after.

In brief, GTD is a methodology for capturing, clarifying, and completing the many pieces of information and requests for our time that cross our paths every day.  It advises collecting _everything_ immediately, deciding if it's something that must be done, delegated, trashed, archived, or incubated, and ultimately executing on what matters most.

At the time, I was a fan of Ryder Carroll's Bullet Journal system - a simple framework of bullets and lists contained within a run-of-the-mill notebook.  My officemates were well acquainted with my habit of carrying a notebook, every page full of small, neat rows of bullets and dashes.  The strictness of my BuJo adherance varied; some days were sparse or missing entirely, others were full accounts of my day.

I was a fan of the Bullet Journal for a few reasons:
1. It used a **physical notebook**.  I love the tactility of a real notebook, the portability.  There's no worrying about some company dropping support for a feature or losing my data.  And at work, I can't log into my personal Google account or easily share data between my work and personal profiles.  A notebook is the perfect solution.
1. It was **simple**.  Learn a few bullets, write down today's day, and you're off.  No additional complexity required.
1. It was **extensible**.  I could doodle, take meeting notes, sketch a design, track my habits, or remember a date with ease.  No preestablished page formats or app limitations to work around.

But I didn't feel like the Bullet Journal worked well for _my_ work.  My work was messy, spontaneous.  The system gave me a way to record my day, but something was missing - more guidance around the _process_, rather than just how to write them down.

Enter GTD.

# Phase One - Google Keep
When I first read GTD, my big takeaway was the presence of five buckets:
* An **Inbox** for capturing notes, mentions, ideas, tasks, and requests
* A **Next Actions** list for those things I can do whenever I'm able
* A **Waiting For** list to capture things that are stuck until someone gets back to me or a specific date arrives
* A **Someday/Maybe** list for things I may want to do in the future
* A **Projects** list for projects (in GTD, any goal with a definite conclusion and more than one action is a Project)
