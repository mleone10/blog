When the COVID pandemic first started and working from home every day became my new reality, the necessity of staying active became far more apparent. As every March 2020 listicle will tell you, establishing a routing or ritual to help delineate between work and play was essential. For me, that meant adopting a new habit - long walks immediately after closing my laptop and calling my workday "done".

On those walks through the neighborhoods near my apartment, I'd do one of three things:

- Listen to nothing, taking in the sounds of the neighborhood,
- Listen to my favorite musical albums, yearning for the eventual-yet-delayed reopening of theaters,
- Listen to podcasts.

I'd shift between them based on my mood, but it was my library of podcasts that was most lacking. I wasn't a huge podcast-listener at the time, but I've since discovered multiple podcasts on a variety of topics that interest me.

## Tabletop Gaming

Ever since [Critical Role](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Role) established a brand new category of online entertainment in 2015, numerous other tabletop "live play" series have sprung up. These (as well as Dungeons and Dragons' prominence in the Netflix series _Stranger Things_) have propelled D&D and the tabletop RPG genre as a whole into a recent resurgence. Some that I like to listen to include:

- [The Critshow](), a [Monster of the Week]() live play series featuring a group of friends fighting through various smaller adventures. Monster of the Week is an lightweight, story-driven system that's perfect for these kinds of tightly contained, improv-heavy shows.
- [Critical Role](), the original D&D live play show, started publishing its Twitch live streams as podcasts after much demand by fans. I don't keep as up to date on these as I'd prefer, but at 3-hours per weekly episode, it's no surprise.
