<a class=p-category href=https://mleone.dev/tags/indieweb/>IndieWeb</a>, <a class=p-category href=https://mleone.dev/tags/blogging/>Blogging</a></span></header><div class=e-content><p>With a few small changes, my site is now meeting some core IndieWeb criteria. Specifically, it:</p><ul><li>Supports Web Sign In</li><li>Contains a well-formatted h-card in the footer</li><li>Marks up each post with h-entry classes</li></ul><p>Web Sign In was easy - just add a link to my GitHub page in <a href=https://github.com/mleone10/blog/commit/c5bf5489c52aa9a1fc3a939e7e867ea6bc95e748#diff-600598ff82d9d72e642b72196d69d7311e20d4ff372c88b2c94021afa844408eR37>the site&rsquo;s footer</a> with a <code>rel=me</code> attribute, and link back to my site on my GitHub page. I&rsquo;ve since added my Mastodon profile, too.</p><p>Adding an h-card presented more of a design challenge than an engineering one. An h-card is just an HTML element with certain classes on its child elements. My <a href=https://github.com/mleone10/blog/commit/77bf619921ac5a60c1cac47db8f410e0d2146fb5#diff-600598ff82d9d72e642b72196d69d7311e20d4ff372c88b2c94021afa844408eR36>first iteration</a> of this featured my name, site URL, and an additional URL to my GitHub profile. I added a <code>u-uid</code> attribute to my site link, tagging it as the page&rsquo;s &ldquo;representational h-card&rdquo;.</p><p>However, two things were missing that I was encouraged by IndieWebify.me to add - a photo and a short bio. I <a href=https://github.com/mleone10/blog/commit/c7efe8cd0e8e5ed99e0540267002c8fd3d88d19a>found a way</a> to fit a small version of my profile picture and a short note in the footer, added the relevant class names, and my h-card was complete. I&rsquo;m pretty happy with how this new footer looks, which is a plus.</p><p>Finally, adding h-entry markup to each blog post was simple. Mostly that just meant <a href=https://github.com/mleone10/blog/commit/1be753e7750d1432f264229ee451e4ebf353186c>adding class names</a> to elements that were already there, though I did have to add a few URLs and <code>div</code>s for good measure.</p><p>The IndieWebify.me validators now show my site as conforming to all recommended aspects of these three facets. Next come the hard parts - supporting Micropub and Webmentions. I&rsquo;ve seen a few ways to do this using a static site, but I think I&rsquo;m going to take this opportunity to explore migrating the core of my site to some kind of dynamic system. I have a few thoughts on how I might do that, so stay tuned for more!</p></div></article></main><footer class="fullWidth h-card"><img class=u-photo src=/profilePic.jpeg>
